Prices of cattle feed and dairy essentials change every week or month because of market demand, weather conditions, oil price changes, and import costs. Different suppliers also offer different rates at different times. If we buy feed during a high-price period or from the wrong supplier, the cost increases. Sometimes suppliers also delay delivery, which can disturb the feeding schedule and affect milk production. By forecasting future prices and checking past supplier performance, we can know the best time to buy and choose reliable suppliers. This helps the farm reduce feed costs, avoid delays, and maintain a steady and healthy feed supply for the cattle.
